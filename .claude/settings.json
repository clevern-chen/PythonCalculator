  "rules": [
    "When committing code changes, always test the code with appropriate tools (syntax check, linting, or running tests) before creating the commit",
    "Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the 'why' not just the 'what'",
    "For multi-file changes, review all changes with git diff before committing",
    "Always check for open GitHub issues before starting new work",
    "When fixing bugs or adding features, reference the relevant issue number in commit messages",
    "Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless absolutely necessary",
    "Keep code changes focused and avoid unnecessary refactoring or 'improvements' beyond the scope of the task",
    "When creating GUI applications, ensure accessibility: proper colors, readable text, keyboard support",
    "For Python projects, always verify syntax with 'python -m py_compile' before committing",
    "When adding new features, update relevant documentation (README, docstrings, comments)",
    "Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly convey purpose",
    "Handle errors gracefully with try-except blocks and user-friendly error messages",
    "Test both mouse and keyboard inputs for GUI applications",
    "Organize code logically: imports at top, helper functions before main logic, main execution at bottom",
    "Use type hints in Python where appropriate for better code clarity",
    "Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility",
    "Add comments only where the logic isn't self-evident",
    "For calculator or math applications, validate input to prevent errors",
    "Maintain consistent code style throughout the project",
    "Before pushing to GitHub, ensure all tests pass and the application runs correctly"
